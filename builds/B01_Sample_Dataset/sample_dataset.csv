"Next, getting him dressed was no easy feat. The first shirt I put on didn’t feel comfortable. This was a brand new pre washed long sleeve t-shirt from Osh Kosh. It’s darling, but unfortunately, new clothes rarely stay on my son. He prefers old and soft. Many of his very favorite clothes and shoes have spots and tears, but they are the only ones that I can get him to stay in. This morning was no different. I put on Gap underwear, Osh Kosh Jeans and the Osh Kosh t-shirt. After he was thoroughly dressed, he started screaming and wailing about the shirt being too small and the pants being too big. So, off the clothes came! And it wasn’t just a calm, “mommy I’m taking off these clothes”, it was a screaming crying whining fit accompanied by throwing his clothes over the room which landed on my husband’s face as he was walking over the room. At least today he didn’t Run when it was time to get him dressed. That is the typical scenario. He races over the room when it’s time to take off his pajamas or time to get changed any time. I can’t figure out why! I don’t know if that is his body having an self-acting reaction to change, or if it’s a behavior issue. But it’s something that we want to work on in occupational therapy.",139609,en_US.blogs

"Stuck in the same cramped room, staring at the same small screen, my cinematic travels have literally taken me nowhere over the years. Oh, sure, the images flickering on its glossy surface portray a wide array of people doing a wide array of things in a wide array of places, but I can't physically touch or interact with them. If I were, however, given the opportunity to enter any film I wanted, I would definitely think about entering Crimes of Passion, an unconventional, somewhat satirical, yet totally trashy erotic thriller written by Barry Sandler (Making Love) and directed by Ken Russell (Lair of the White Worm). Why, may I ask, would you want to enter that particular film? I mean, what makes it so special? And besides, everyone says they want to penetrate the film they just finished watching, it's human nature. In fact, I know someone who wanted to live like the drug-addled fashion models in Liquid Sky so badly, that they moved to Manhattan, bought a penthouse apartment near the Empire State Building, and started a trendy heroin habit. While I won't be moving to this film's location (L.A.'s skid row) anytime soon, I did notice that the desire to install a flashing neon sign, preferably one with an x-rated theme, outside my bedroom window was quite pronounced after I had finished bathing in its unsavoury glow. In other words, I want to live in a world where lightness and darkness are always fighting one another for radioactive supremacy. It's true, the inconsistencies that come with existing in a realm that features two distinct types of illumination will take some getting used to, but most will agree that the varying degrees of visual comprehension are the one of the signature perks of living life on the edge.",285772,en_US.blogs

While authoring several biographies (John Murray, A.W.Pink and John Wesley), Iain Murray’s main intention has been to use history to recover commitment to the doctrines of Scripture, particularly the doctrines of grace. He did this first in The Forgotten Spurgeon (1966), and again in Pentecost—Today?The Biblical Basis for Understanding Revival (1998). More general is his Evangelicalism Divided: A Record of Crucial Change in the Years 1950 to 2000 (2000), which, despite its controversial nature, became one of his best-selling hardbacks.

Why would someone want to pass on a terminal genetic illness to their offspring if it could be avoided? There is a difference between parenting and procreating. Only a real narcissist would insist on passing on his genetic illness or abnormality to his offspring just because…. People who want to parent can always adopt. The last prospective positive use of negative eugenics could be manifest in using gene therapy to prevent such illnesses (when it becomes available).",732958,en_US.blogs

I've always loved camping, and used to go all the time. Every summer as a kid, every summer as a teenager, pretty much up until I had Celeste. Then I was too apprehensive about camping with a little one, and I have a hard time leaving her with anyone, so now that she is old enough, we took her on her first camping trip.

Most of the health problems have been Tori's, with Bella having a few of her own. Tori is in and out of the hospital, on medications, and still receieving a feeding tube occassionally. So the twins' mom will determine whether or not they are well enough to come for a weekend and a lot of the weekends, she decides to keep them home depending on the circumstance.

"The tenor of the current debate frightens me, as it heralds a return to another age when women were not the trustees of decisions made about their own bodies. What I hope for other women is that they have the power to make their own decisions with as much information as it is possible to have, with respect to the specificity and complexity of their own circumstances, according to their own minds and hearts and not the dictates of another person’s worldview. Santorum believes that all life is inherently valuable, no matter how compromised or of what limited quality; that is one view. I believe that we need a more nuanced discussion about what quality of life is, and that it should be a woman's right to choose to terminate a pregnancy when the path of her child’s life is as compromised—and as terrible—as my son’s. Rapp would like, I would like, a more nuanced discussion about what quality of life is, but I'm not sure we can have that at this political moment in this country. I feel that I am on the side of my fellow women when we argue for our rights to make reproductive decisions, to have access to birth control, by god, to hold jobs. But I don't know if these same women are on my side when I say my son has a right to an education, to healthcare, to a decent quality of life. Because all of those things are extremely expensive. And we Americans take capitalism very seriously, allowing the concept of value to seep into discussions about human beings. Once ""value"" poisons the well, my child doesn't stand a chance--it's too easy for Americans to conflate quality of life with whether a life is worth living or which lives have more value. We can't have a nuanced discussion until we can separate those concepts.",761374,en_US.blogs

Under their Portuguese owners, they have changed dramatically and are in the process of trying to establish a reputation for quality. Their advertising promotion of their quality, like that of their rivals Lidl, gives me the impression of miss-truth and manipulation of facts. More valuable to me, is the new design of their shops, which takes away the 'pile em high and sell them cheap' entrance look of the shop, replacing it with a more open and welcoming display.",594021,en_US.blogs

"The best part of the night for me (aside from the part where in my head I decide that Chef Ludo himself designed the night's awesome 90s-hip-hop playlist) was my vantage point. Overall, I wasn't thrilled with the space: Lemon Moon is a cafeteria in an office complex, and the ambiance of its bright, spacious dining room just didn't match the excitement of the night. But it has an open kitchen, and from my seat, I could watch as one chef prepped plate after plate, using an empty glass display case as his work station. He was meticulous about every detail, and I watched as Chef Ludo peered intently over his shoulder, hanging on every drop of sauce, making sure each dish was just perfect. In that moment, all the LudoBites fanfare made sense: every item I was served was at the highest level. Chef Ludo and his team took great pains to achieve harmony from a wild array of complex flavors, to make every plate beautiful. A world of mindful effort is behind every bite. He's pulling out all the stops, putting all he has out there. In that moment, I totally got the LudoBitches.

"Colonel Qaddafi is relentlessly anti-Israel, supports the most extreme factions in Syria and opposes the moderating influences of Jordan’s King Hussein and Egypt’s Anwar el-Sadat as part of his campaign of political expansion in North Africa. Qaddafi’s ambitions were strengthened early this year when he successfully invaded Chad, seizing an area believed to be rich in uranium ore. The war also meant more profit for Wilson, who has established his own trading company in Tripoli, known as Meprico, to supply Qaddafi’s army. Libya, relying on its estimated $25 billion in annual oil revenues, is a major purchaser of Soviet arms, and more than 5,000 Warsaw Pact military advisers are believed to be on duty with Qaddafi’s 60,000-man army. A former high-speed-communications and computer-technology expert in the C.I.A., Kevin Mulcahy was no innocent when he came forward about the way the export-import business had worked. He had gone into business with Wilson and Terpil at a high guaranteed income. Within three months, Mulcahy realized that his partners were routinely selling restricted military and communications gear. He himself offered to sell such sophisticated equipment as second-generation computer systems and coded communications machinery. Mulcahy did not hesitate in his talks with the authorities to acknowledge his own role in questionable activities, which included the sale of embargoed ammunition to South Africa. In all of these dealings, he says, he believed or wanted to believe that Wilson and Terpil were somehow part of a covert C.I.A. operation.",343836,en_US.blogs

"5. In Game 4, for the first time in this series, Pujols did not have an at-bat with a runner in scoring position. The Cardinals' first baseman didn't take a swing with a runner on base at all against Randy Wolf. Pujols is 3-for-4 with two intentional walks in six plate appearances with runners in scoring position this season, and one of the biggest deterrents for pitching around Pujols is not who is behind him - it's who is on base ahead of him. Consider Game 2: Jay scored three of the five runs that Pujols drove in that evening. Protection is one thing. Prevention is also important. Enter Rafael Furcal. A Brewers slayer in the regular season, Furcal has vanished in this series. He went hitless in five at-bats on Thursday, and he's batting .167 in the series. Furcal has walked only once to up his on-base percentage to .211. That's no way to ignite and offense and it's a good recipe to give Brewers the ability to avoid Pujols, or limit his impact.
